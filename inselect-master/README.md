Inselect is a desktop application that automates the cropping of individual images of
specimens from whole-drawer scans and similar images that are generated by
digitisation of museum collections. It combines image processing, barcode
reading, validation of user-defined metadata and batch processing to offer a high
level of automation. Inselect runs on Windows and Mac OS X and is open-source.

User documentation is on the
[Inselect website](https://naturalhistorymuseum.github.io/inselect/).

## Development environments

Inselect is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Qt](http://www.qt.io/)
and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). Read instructions for
[developing on Mac OS X](DevelopingOnMacOSX.md),
[developing on Windows](DevelopingOnWindows.md) and [releasing](Releasing.md).
Versions of Inselect between v0.1.1 to v0.1.34 inclusive run on Python 2.7.
Starting with v0.1.35, Inselect runs on Python 3 only. This should not affect
you unless you are running Inselect on Linux - see
[developing on Linux](DevelopingOnLinux.md) for instructions.
