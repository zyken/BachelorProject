Title: Inselect

Inselect is a desktop application that automates the cropping of individual images of
specimens from whole-drawer scans and similar images that are generated by
digitisation of museum collections. It combines image processing, barcode
reading, validation of user-defined metadata and batch processing to offer a
high level of automation. Inselect runs on Windows and Mac OS X and is
open-source.

## The problem

Natural history collections are vast and varied and present many substantial
challenges to digitisation.
At the [Natural History Museum, London](https://www.nhm.ac.uk),
for example, there are an estimated 33 million insect specimens, housed in 130
thousand drawers:

It is a lot easier and quicker to image 130 thousand drawers rather than 33
million individual insects. However, by themselves drawer-level images are not
very useful. Manually cropping each image takes too much time and without unique
identifiers the individual images are of questionable value.

**The challenge is to efficiently get a single image of each object along
with its associated metadata.**

## How Inselect helps
Inselect aims to solve many of the problems associated with whole-drawer imaging
including

* identifying individual specimens, along with any associated labels,
* placing a bounding box around each,
* cropping out specimen-level images,
* capturing metadata such as catalogue numbers, location within the collection,
and possibly information on labels and
* associating metadata with the cropped images.
