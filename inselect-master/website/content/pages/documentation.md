Title: Documentation

### Background reading
You can find out about Inselect from

* the [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/) webinar, *Insights into Inselect:
automating image processing, barcode reading, and validation of user-defined
metadata*, available as a
[video](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3208021.v2) and via
[Adobe Connect](https://idigbio.adobeconnect.com/p7qo63aeo4a/) (additional
software required), and
* the PLOS ONE paper
[*Inselect: automating the digitization of natural history collections*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0143402).

### Exercises
We plan to create comprehensive user documentation for Inselect.
The following documentation is written as exercises for you to follow.
The files for exercises are available in
[a zipfile](https://nhm.box.com/s/0oo5vaabypxsgt9zzcz7b6o5xg4yjrba)
(250MB).
Many digitisation pipelines use `TIFF` images. Whole-drawer `TIFF` images can
be extremely large - files of up to 800MB are common. These examples use `JPG`
files in order to minimize amount of data that you need to download.

1. [Introduction]({filename}/pages/introduction.md)
2. [Image handling, file handling and bounding boxes]({filename}/pages/image_handling_and_boxes.md)
3. [Metadata templates]({filename}/pages/metadata_templates.md)
4. [Barcode reading]({filename}/pages/barcode_reading.md)
5. [Cookie cutter]({filename}/pages/cookie_cutter.md)
6. [Command-line tools]({filename}/pages/command_line_tools.md)

These materials are based on a workshop given at a joint
[iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/) and
[SYNTHESYS](http://www.synthesys.info/) workshop
*Selected tools for automated metadata capture from specimen images*,
Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum, Berlin, June 2016.
