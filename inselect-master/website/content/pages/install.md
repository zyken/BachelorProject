Title: Install

Download and run the appropriate installer for the latest release of Inselect
from the
[releases page](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/inselect/releases).

### Mac OS X
Download and open the `.dmg` file.

### Windows
Windows users should download and run one of the `.msi` files

* `amd64` if using 64-bit Windows,
* `win32` if using 32-bit Windows.

64-bit Windows is recommended given that Inselect workflows often involve
dealing with very large image files.
