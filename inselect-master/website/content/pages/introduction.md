Title: Introduction

Start Inselect. You should see a list of keyboard shortcuts.

On Windows, many
shortcuts are activated by holding down the `CTRL` key together with another key.
On a Mac, the command button (`âŒ˜`) is used instead of `CTRL`.

There are two 'views' of an Inselect document.

## The Boxes view

This shows a zoomable, low resolution version of the whole-drawer image,
together with bounding boxes:

## The Objects view

This shows a grid of icons, one icon for each bounding box:

## The toolbar and status bar
The toolbar offers functions relevant to the currently selected view.
The status bar at the bottom shows feedback and help.

### Navigator

where the Boxes view is zoomed to:
