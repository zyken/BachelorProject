### Why is Inselect not a cloud service?
The whole-drawer scans and similar images that are generated by digitisation of
museum collections are typically very large - `TIFF` files between 600MB and
800MB are common. The transmission times and storage costs of dealing with such
files make a cloud based infrastructure impractical, given our resources.
