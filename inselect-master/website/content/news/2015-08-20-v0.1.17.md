Title: Inselect v0.1.17 released

You can [download v0.1.17](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/inselect/releases/tag/v0.1.17).

- Added [171](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/inselect/issues/171) - Processing double-sided objects (@quicklizard99)

If you are using the Inlite ClearImage commercial barcode reading SDK (available for Windows only), you will need to:
1. Download either  `library-0.1.17-32.zip` (if you are using 32-bit Windows) or `library-0.1.17-64.zip` (if you are using 64-bit Windows) below
2. Rename the file that you downloaded to `library.zip`
3. Close Inselect
4. Copy `library.zip` over the existing file in `C:\Program Files\inselect`, or wherever it was that you installed Inselect

This is due to a bug in the Windows Installer that Inselect uses; see [Inselect Issue 130](https://github.com/NaturalHistoryMuseum/inselect/issues/130).
